# Treasure_Hunt
This is a small game that I made in a Java class in school.

I used JRE version 1.8 (8) with JDK 8

To compile:
javac *.java

The main file is called Adventure and you need to specify a map .txt file to create the map.
Make sure to have MapPics folder, map1items.txt (this file should not be edited) and the map.txt in the same directory as the java files

To run:
java Adventure map1.txt

map1.txt can be a customized n x m matrix with images in the pictures folder.

When saving a game, the file type must have .dat extension

commands:
go east (moves left)
go west (moves right)
go north (moves up)
go south (moves down)
